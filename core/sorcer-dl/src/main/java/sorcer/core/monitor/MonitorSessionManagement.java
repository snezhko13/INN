/**
 * A server side session manager. Clients call on session manager to manage
 * individual sessions data.
 * 
 * The session is activated by the manager when init(monitorable, duration,
 * timeout) is called by broker. From this moment, the Manager will require that
 * the monitorable renew the leases for the specified duration. If the task is
 * not complete for the specified duration, the monitor will send stop signal to
 * the monitorable and notify the Broker via RemoteEventListener.notify().
 * 
 * For Space based programming, since we don't know who will execute the job,
 * broker calls init(space, timeout, duration). This means that the monitor is
 * going to mark the timeout and duration of this session. Note that from this
 * moment, the session is not activated. It waits till the timeout period for
 * some monitorable provider to pick up and call init(monitorable). From this
 * moment on, the session is activated and leases have to be renewed.
 * 
 * Once providers revieves the session (which is normally sent inside the
 * exertion) They may call update() stop() getLease() or getState(). The
 * getState is actually delegated to the SessionManager remotely.
