SORCER-multiFi 
==============

Service-ORiented Computing EnviRonment (SORCER) is a service-oriented platform developed at the SORCER Lab (http://sorcersoft.org) in collaboration with Multidisciplinary Science and Technology Center (MSTC), AFRL/WPAFB.

It allows to create and provision service providers in the network and express emergent service-oriented processes in the Service Mogramming Language (SML) by multifidelity request services. Request services are actualized by the SORCER service operating system (SOS) that creates local/remote cooperations of service providers at runtime.
